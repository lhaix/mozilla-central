MacOS requires that applications be started by a binary in the application bundle;
violating that requirement leads to strange behavior from the Application menu.

The foxlauncher program finds an installed Firefox executable by using NSWorkspace
methods (or a developer-specified override).  It then creates a directory inside
the application bundle, symlinks the Firefox executable directory's contents (including
firefox-bin as well as all supporting files and directories) into it, and executes that.
