These are localized strings for the webapp runtime, which loads a webapp
in a separate process from Firefox.  Webapps loaded in this way have very little
application chrome, but the runtime does provide them with some default
functionality, like the standard OS menus/menuitems.  This directory provides
the strings for that default functionality.
